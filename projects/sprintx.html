            <h1>Skillz SprintX</h1>
            <p>This page will tell you all about my Sprint X project called Skillz. I've always wanted to do more than just HTML/CSS so, after asking someone that I know who works in this field, I decided that I would use Next.js with Tailwind and Typescript as I've been told that that is basically industry standard nowadays. This project was made with the help of AI. </p>

                    <h2>The Project</h2>
                    <div class="underline"></div>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>This project started a couple of weeks before the end of <a href="zekur.html">the Fix That UX project</a>. I got approached by the client. They knew that I was proficient in making websites and they were wondering if I could help them with a possible project they were thinking of. As it had no set deadline, I was told that I could work on it whenever, making it the perfect project to get started on for my Sprint X.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Setting Goals and Planning</h3>
                    <p>I sat down with the client and made a list of what the application should be capable of. Afterward, I debriefed it myself and broke it down into parts. That way I could come up with an MVP, a Minimum Viable Product. This would basically be my goal to create—it would be what they already have but digitalized. That way, I can use that as a base to work on, adding feature after feature to eventually create the best possible product.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Understanding the Client's Needs</h3>
                    <p>They were currently using an Excel sheet with their students and projects printed out on A2 paper in their classroom to keep track of student progression throughout the year. This obviously wasn't ideal, and they wanted to digitalize and simplify it.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Designing the Wireframes</h3>
                    <p>Now that I had a goal, I could start making a design in Figma. For these wireframes, I stuck to basic low fidelity since functionality was most important for this client, and I didn't have a lot of time.</p>
                    <p>Creating these wireframes helped me visualize the ideas I had. When I was satisfied, I asked my coach for his thoughts, and he pointed out that I shouldn't forget the main functionality of the Excel sheet—being able to see all information in one quick overview. To accommodate this, I made an iteration of the student screen after selecting a class to show all students and projects in one, just like an Excel table would.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Receiving Feedback and Approval</h3>
                    <p>Next up was to show the client the work I had done. They were happy with the progress I had made and the design I came up with. They asked if they could get a copy of the design and show it to their colleagues the next day to get their opinions. The next day, I got told that they were all happy with the design, saying it was easy to understand, even for older teachers that aren't good with technology, and they were looking forward to my progression.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Learning New Tools and Technologies</h3>
                    <p>After the designs were satisfactory and I had an idea of what I wanted to make, it was time to start <a href="../learning-outcomes/development.html#sprintx">coding</a>. After consulting a friend of mine who works in this field for over 10 years now, he suggested I should try <a href="../learning-outcomes/professional-standards.html#languages">using Next.js, Tailwind, and Typescript.</a> He told me that these coding languages are commonly used nowadays and it would be good for me to start learning these as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>I had never used any of these languages before, so learning them in the short time I had was already a challenge enough. Coupling that with the fact that I wanted to combine this project with a database where the teachers could store all the project and student information meant that I would have to learn how to integrate that as well.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Using AI to Support Development</h3>
                    <p>During the last feedback session with my assessors, one of them mentioned it might be interesting to see how smart AI is nowadays and how far it could get you in a project. I was told about a new AI tool called Cursor, which looked more promising than ChatGPT for coding.</p>
                    <p>I figured I could use Cursor to learn these new languages and see how good it would be at building a project from scratch. I started with basic queries such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create an application using Next.js, Typescript, and Tailwind for teachers to monitor student progression.</li>
                        <li>Show me an example of a file structure that I should use to create the project.</li>
                        <li>I want to add a database to this project. How should I go about this?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cursor could look at the code I was working on, acting as an in-built AI like GitHub Copilot. It would suggest changes, explain them, and even let me apply them instantly with a single click.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Challenges with the Database</h3>
                    <p>The only issue I ran into was creating the database and coupling it with the project. I tried Drizzle and Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL but couldn't get it to work properly. As a workaround, I used mock data since this was just a proof of concept. Thankfully, the mock data was easily written with the help of Cursor.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Finalizing the Application</h3>
                    <p>I didn't focus too much on style as I was focused on just getting the program to function properly, and the client didn't care much for styling. However, I did use Tailwind to alter some things. Thanks to my knowledge of CSS, Tailwind was familiar, and using a <a href="https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet" target="_blank">Tailwind Cheat Sheet</a>, I could easily make major style adjustments.</p>
                    <p>In the end, I was able to create a functioning proof of concept. I showed it to the client, and they were happy with the progress I had made. After the semester is over, I want to add all the features I had planned to and further improve the program.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>I think that this project was the most enjoyable I have had this semester and taught me a lot about coding. Every time I worked on it, I had the impression that I was genuinely getting better as a programmer.</p>
