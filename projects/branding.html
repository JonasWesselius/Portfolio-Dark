            <h1>Studio Patched Branding</h1>
            <p>This page will tell you all about how I worked together with my group members to create a coherent branding for our design studio: "Patched."
                It will show the progression and decisions that led to our final product.

                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>This entire project started all over the place since I just got placed into the 3rd semester after having worked on my <a href="../projects/theatre.html">Blik Theatre Project</a> for about a week. Half my project group was also missing and nobody knew where they were. </p>
                <p>I tried taking the lead within the group seeing as the only person who was there at the time didn't seem like he wanted to do anything, and he also told me he'd rather be told exactly what to do since he can't think of that himself. </p>
                <p>Seeing my group not wanting to take the initiative I decided to start thinking of tasks and appointing them to members, we needed a logo, colourscheme and typography, all this should be put together in a coherent brandguide.  </p>
                <p>But before anything could be started on, we needed a name for our studio, before I joined the group they where thinking of the name "Graphic Alley" but that was deemed "too dark, edgy and moody" by our teachers, so after some brainstorming I thought of the name "Patched Studio" patched having a double meaning that being: a software patch to symbolize our specialization in coding, and patching something up to symbolize that we can patch someones branding up if it needs it. </p>
                <p>After the name was decided everyone could start working and we all made some <a href="../learning-outcomes/iterative-design.html#logo">logo iterations,</a> then we did some discussing and voting, we came to the conclusion that one of my other team member's design was the best for our studio.</p>
                <p>Next up was to start doing some research on typography and colourschemes, we all took the time and put together some colourschemes that we thought worked well and then just like with the logos we talked about them and voted on what we thought would be best.</p>
                <p>We ended up choosing a colourscheme that was like Visual Studio Code's dark colourscheme to once again link back to our specialization in coding</p>
                <p>Lastly we need typography for our small brandguide we all agreed that Roboto would be a good basic and clean font that would bring across the message of minimalism that our studio stands for.</p>
                <p>One of my members was responsible for putting everything together in a coherent brandguide with misuses and everything, while I started working on the <a href="../learning-outcomes/iterative-design.html#patched">wireframes,</a> after multiple iterations and eventually adding the style to make it a full mockup i could call this project finished.</p>
                <p>We debated whether or not we should have coded our website to really bring our studio to life but considering the time we had we choose not to, and start focussing on the next project: <a href="../projects/fairytales.html">AI Fairytales.</a></p>
