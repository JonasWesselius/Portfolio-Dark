            <h1>AI Fairytales</h1>
            <p>This page will tell you all about how I worked on my project AI Fairytales as part of Patched Studio. I only got to work on part of the project since I got transferred back to semester 2 before I got the chance to finish it.
            My contribution to this project was only in the starting phase of it. Because of that I worked on brainstorming, researching, concept ideas and wireframing.

                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>This project got introduced to us by our client earlier than other classes. We figured that eventhough the other classes are still working on their studio branding, we should start working on this project as soon as possible. </p>
                <p>And that started with debriefing. The client gave us a presentation of their idea and basically left the style up to us. Thankfully they ended their presentation with a list of Must have's, Should have's, and Could have's. This gave us a guideline for what our product should be able of doing.</p>  
                <p>After that is was up to us to do <a href="../learning-outcomes/professional-standards.html#research">research</a> like figuring out what our target audience was, what is the market like in terms of fairytales created by AI, and the consequences of using digital fairytales for children.</p>
                <p>Part of our research was also to create a <a href="../learning-outcomes/media-products.html#survey">survey.</a> The goal of it was to gather information on important topics including storytelling preferences, the value of educational materials, and desired interface. We didn't end up getting the desired amount of responses out of this survey but we figured any response was better than no response.</p>
                <p>While waiting for our survey answers to come in we also thought of asking our parents and parents that we know some questions like an interview, this would also give us some extra information on what they might like or maybe use.</p>
                <p>When we finished researching we had another brainstorming session to give each other feedback on the research we individually did. The next step was to create some concept ideas of what we could make and if they already exist or not.</p>
                <p>We quickly came to the opinion of what it should be, we thought an application or webapp would suit this project best as we thought it should be accessible, easy to use, and feasible for us to create. </p>
                <p>I took responsibility of <a href="../learning-outcomes/iterative-design.html#concept">creating wireframes</a> as I didn't have any faith in my team members to complete any task to my satisfaction and I also quite like designing.</p>
                <p>After iterating my wireframes a couple times I sadly ran out of time, as i got <a href="../learning-outcomes/professional-standards.html#pivot">transferred back to semester 2.</a> I wanted to finish the project and it quite irritating to leave it in the state that it was in, but I had no other choice.</p>
                <p>I had a vision of what I thought the application would look like, I had so many features I wanted to work on and implement properly. Now I don't even know how the project ended as my old studio didn't even show up to present their project to the client.</p>
                <p>This project left a bad taste in my mouth in terms of group members and how the entire semester was going with all the transferring going on. But I had to pivot to a clean mind as I was about to take on the hard task of doing a 4 week project in just 2 weeks: <a href="zekur.html">Fix That UX.</a></p>
