            <h1>Blik Theatre Branding</h1>
            <p>This page will tell you all about how I worked together with my group members to help a relatively new playback theatre "Blik" with a rebranding.
                Since I only had a week or two before getting moved to semester 3, it will only show a few things I got to make.

                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>This was the first project of the semester, we had to form groups and get to know each other in the introduction week, after which our class got the task to rebrand an up and coming playback theatre Blik.</p> 
                <p>Our first objective was to make a <a href="../learning-outcomes/media-products.html#moodboard">moodboard</a> for Blik. The goal was to capture the essence of the theatre so that we could get a feeling of what we were working with.</p>
                <p>Each of us made a moodboard individually, then we discussed each others moodboards and vote on which one fits the emotion best related to Blik. We ended up choosing a different members moodboard, but we also took inspiration from other moodboards created by team members.</p>
                <p>After the moodboards were finished we figured the next best course of action would be to create a <a href="../learning-outcomes/media-products.html#stylescape">stylescape</a> with our idea of what Blik should look like. Since they didn't have any style of themselves we had complete free reign over the assignment.</p>
                <p>Just like the moodboards we talked about the stylescapes, everyone elaborated on their choices, and eventually ended up voting for a stylescape that we thought would best suit the new rebranded Blik.</p>
                <p>We ended up not choosing my stylescape but I still learned a lot from working on these assignments and discussing them with my team members.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately this is where my part in this project ends as <a href="../learning-outcomes/professional-standards.html#pivot">I got transferred to semester 3</a> and I had to start <a href="../projects/branding.html">creating my own design studio</a> for that semester.</p>
                <p>It was bittersweet as I was really looking forward to working on this rebranding project but i also wanted to go on to semester 3, I think my team members are fully capable of finishing this project properly and helping the theatre find their style.</p>
