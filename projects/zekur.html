            <h1>Fix That UX</h1>
            <p>This page will tell u about how I got started on this project to fix a websites user experience and how I later went on to code it.</p>

                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>This project started for me after the autumn break when I just got placed back to semester 2, after talking to the teachers on what would be the best way to go about this project seeing as I joined in the middle of it.</p>
                <p>I didn't want to go back to my original group and I also didn't feel like awkwardly joining a new group of people halfway through their project, so we decided it would be best if I did this part of the project on my own.</p>
                <p>After just joining in on the midterm presentations I got a feeling of where all the groups where at in the project, together with me coach I made a tight <a href="../learning-outcomes/professional-standards.html#planning">schedule using trello,</a> as I somehow had to do this 4 week project in just 2 weeks time.</p>
                <p>My project started with doing <a href="../learning-outcomes/professional-standards.html#ux">research</a> on the 3 options I had; Zilveren Kruis, GGZ, and ZEKUR. I went through the happyflows and noted down the painpoints one might have with the websites.</p>
                <p>I quickly came to the conclusion that ZEKUR had the most blatant painpoints, navigation was tedious and unclear, font was massive, things weren't clearly explained, they just assumed u knew everything. </p>
                <p>Next was to <a href="../learning-outcomes/iterative-design.html#fixthatux">create a wireframe</a> that would solve most of these issues, I tried to stick to their current style as much as possible, I also redid their navigation, implemented tables for an easier overview of what each package had to offer you and much more.</p>
                <p>After 2 weeks it was time to go to amsterdam and <a href="../learning-outcomes/professional-standards.html#presenting">present to our client Hike One.</a> I was last to present and the client was surprised by this as they obviously had never seen me before. Nevertheless they were impressed with the work I was able to put up in the short time span and they complimented my presenting skills, although I should try and use easier english vocabulary to make sure everyone understands.</p>
                <p>Now that the designing phase was done it was time to code it. This had to be done in new groups so I got to work together with 2 other group members on this.</p>
                <p>At first we had to look at our designs and figure out what we were going to code. We went for their design and implemented some of my features on it like the tables and, navigation and a progressbar.</p>
                <p>Before we moved on to coding the website I wanted to do a quick <a href="../learning-outcomes/media-products.html#usertestux">user test</a> to figure out if what we have in mind is actually what a consumer would also like.</p>
                <p>After a satisfactory result from the test it was actually time to start <a href="../learning-outcomes/development.html#zekur">coding,</a> we divided the pages to make sure we worked efficiently.</p>
                <p>To make sure we weren't overwriting each others code I taught them how to use Github properly and gave each of them their own branch to work in.</p>
                <p>Finally after a couple weeks of coding it was time for our final presentation for Hike One, this one was online and all we had to do was present our website and what we improved about ZEKUR's previous webpage.</p>
                <p>The client was satisfied with our work and I could move on to the next project <a href="sprintx.html">my SprintX.</a></p>
