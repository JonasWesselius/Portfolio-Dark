            <h1>Portfolio</h1>
            <p> This page will tell you all about how I began my portfolio project in Semester 3 using a GitWiki. But because I got transferred back to semester 2 I had to switch to creating a more conventional website. I started out with a light-themed design, but as I developed it, I made the decision to totally redo it into a cleaner, darker look that more accurately represents my personal taste.  </p>
        </div>

    <div class="sectionParent">
        <div class="anchor" id="project"></div>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="further-detail">
                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                
                <h3>Starting in Semester 2</h3>
                <p>I started this semester in semester 2 but as I still has my case going on with the exam committee I had to start the new semester while knowing I might move on to semester 3 regardless, because of this I didn't start working on my portfolio until I had more information on this.</p>
                
                <h3>Transitioning to Semester 3</h3>
                <p>After hearing I could move on to semester 3 under the condition I repair my old portfolio I could finally start working on my new portfolio. The requirements were that we created a GitWiki to utilize its in build hierarchy and structure.</p>
                <p>While repairing my old portfolio I was also working on the new portfolio and creating a reading guide to put in. This reading guide was supposed to be the core of my new portfolio and explain all of my projects, after which u could then go to the GitWiki and learn more about specific products.</p>
                
                <h3>Moving Back to Semester 2</h3>
                <p>When I heard that I didn't pass the regrading of my old portfolio and I had to <a href="../learning-outcomes/professional-standards.html#pivot">move back to semester 2,</a> it also meant that I had new requirements for my portfolio, turns out in semester 2 they don't use GitWiki and I had to create my own website. </p>
                <p>This all happened in the middle of the semester after I just had my first positive feedback moment in semester 3 regarding my GitWiki, I now instantly after the holiday had my "second" portfolio review for semester 2 while I didn't have anything other than a burden of proof with some of the work I had done.</p>
                
                <h3>Balancing Multiple Projects</h3>
                <p>Seeing this, my assessors gave me an extra week to come up with something and show them, but at the same time I also had to do the <a href="zekur.html">Fix That UX Project</a> in 2 weeks so I couldn't afford to lose time on that.</p>
                <p>After showing pretty much nothing again for the second portfolio review I had to step up my game to try and redeem myself before the end of the semester. I started with <a href="../learning-outcomes/iterative-design.html#portfolio">designing and wireframing</a> my portfolio, I wanted to create a light theme with purple so that's what i went for.</p>
                
                <h3>Feedback and Iteration</h3>
                <p>For my third portfolio review I had a live website with some learning outcomes filled. Their feedback on this was that my usertests were missing since these are required, my development and professional standard didn't have any written out content, and my iterative design didn't show a full insight in such a process. Needless to say I needed to continue working hard to pass the semester</p>
                
                <h3>Final Push</h3>
                <p>I created a new design and showed it to my coach, after some feedback and discussing it together I started creating the new website. After that I spent the entire christmas break documenting and writing my learning outcomes, all while I was doing my <a href="sprintx.html">sprintX project.</a></p>
                <p>Finally I had 1 more meeting with my coach a week before my deadline, He thought everything was a big step up from what I handed in last year, he recognized certain elements from my previous portfolio so I explained that it was to save time as I had a tight schedule. He did have a little bit of feedback:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Remove glow on Home elements to keep it minimal, make learning outcomes purple on hover instead.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Update Home to have the correct and up-to-date navigation.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Add structure to project pages with subheadings.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Try to link certain tasks in a learning outcome to other tasks in different learning outcomes like <a href="../learning-outcomes/development.html#sprintx">development sprintx</a> and <a href="../learning-outcomes/professional-standards.html#languages">professional standards using new coding languages.</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>After implementing this feedback I could call my portfolio finished.</p>
