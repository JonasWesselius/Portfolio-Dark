                <h2>Logo Patched Studio</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>One of the most important steps in building our brand identity was designing the Patched Studio logo. Because we worked together, everyone was able to submit original ideas, which resulted in a thoughtful and vast design process.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Our studio, Patched Studio, required a logo. We made the decision to work as a team, and each member came up with early logo suggestions that we all reviewed. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> In order to creatively and visually portray the core values of Patched Studio, I was tasked with coming up with a couple logo options that included our studio's initials.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I started with paper drawings, experimenting with several logo concepts centered around the initials "P" and "S." I used Adobe Illustrator to polish the sketches that my peers and I liked the best after getting their input. I eventually settled on a circular shape and continued to refine it to create a simple, unified logo.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  The team responded positively to my final design when I presented it to them. My logo was praised for its creative interpretation of initial-based logos and provided important inspiration for the final choice, even though we ultimately decided on a different team member's design.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The value of teamwork and design iteration was showcased with this task. It emphasized that the process and feedback may have a big impact on the end product and improve teamwork even if a design is not chosen.</p>

                <h2>Wireframes Concept AI Fairytales</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>This task demonstrates my design studio's teamwork in creating a concept for an interactive WebApp that provides customized bedtime stories. By offering customizable, educational, and child-friendly stories, the app sought to assist parents, caretakers, and teachers as a primary target audience. I thought of the focuspoints on modification and archiving, also i created the wireframe design to make the concept a reality, even though the client supplied all the necessary specifications. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> The client requested a concept that utilized their API for AI storytelling, since parents have trouble finding personalized, interesting bedtime stories, also having to keep buying books for your children is very expensive nowadays. After receiving a list of criteria, my team came up with extra areas of focus to improve the project.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> I was in charge of making wireframes, focusing in on important aspects like archiving and personalization, and making sure the idea matched the requirements of the client and the user experience.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Worked together with the group to identify important areas of focus, such as personalization and accessibility.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Created wireframes that detailed the user experience, including story creating, archiving, and login.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Created extensive customization choices for story components such as themes, settings, and characters.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Suggested an archiving mechanism to preserve characters and stories while supporting continuity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  After showing my team and teachers the wireframes my additions were positively recognized, pointing out the app's accessibility and user-friendly design, especially in the areas of customization and archiving. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The importance of communication within the team, and user-centered design was shown in this part of the project. I'm sure that if i was still part of this semester I could've created a superb product, unfortunately I will never know seeing as i got moved back to the previous semester.</p>

                <h2>Wireframes Fix That UX</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I made wireframes that targeted important UX pain points for ZEKUR, a Dutch health insurance firm, in order to enhance their user experience. Because I entered the project late, it needed to be completed quickly, but I was still able to make significant changes that the client was pleased with.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> I was given the task to assess the user experience of Zilveren Kruis, CZ, and ZEKUR, three healthcare organizations. The goal was to find UX problems and choose the business that needed the greatest work. ZEKUR stood out because of a number of serious UX issues.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> Within a short timeframe, I had to examine ZEKUR's user path, pinpoint problems, and create better wireframes to showcase a more user-friendly experience.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I identified several major issues with ZEKUR's user experience:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Fonts that were too large caused misalignment and readability issues.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">No progress bar left users unsure of their position in the process.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Complex terms lacked explanations, confusing first-time users.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The poor layout made package comparison difficult.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To address these, I created a comparison table to streamline package selection, added a progress tracker, clarified terminology, and redesigned the header for easier navigation. All work was completed swiftly to meet the project deadline.</p>            
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  I successfully presented wireframes that addressed ZEKUR's UX issues in spite of the deadline restrictions. The client was pleased with the enhancements and was especially pleased with the level of quality and efficiency of my work.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The importance of quick, targeted problem-solving under pressure was highlighted by this task. It validated my capacity to produce well-considered design solutions on short notice without sacrificing too much quality. </p>

                <h2>Wireframes Patched</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Starting with a low-fidelity structure, I created wireframes for our studio website, iterating it several times in response to color schemes, layout suggestions, and design inspiration. The finished design effectively struck a mix between a creative, inviting vibe and coding aesthetics.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Our studio required a website design that reflected our creative brand and ability to code. It was my responsibility to produce wireframes that would develop into a well-designed, appealing prototype.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> In order to achieve a visually appealing and helpful website design, my objective was to develop and refine wireframes while taking into account changing color schemes and input from teachers and team members. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Began with low-fidelity wireframes that concentrated on the fundamental layout and structure.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Created a bright color scheme at first, which I then changed to a darker one.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Contributed additional design and pictures to improve the mockup and took into account layout suggestions from the team.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The wireframes were modified to fit the team's color design, which was influenced by the dark theme of Visual Studio Code.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Changed to a more vivid color scheme with more dramatic images in response to teacher feedback.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Green accents were added to the final version, which matched the team's decision.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  The finished wireframes demonstrated a well-balanced design that combined the lively creativity expected of a design studio with the specialized vibe associated with our knowledge of coding. Teachers and team members were all satisfied work.This meant that they were ready to be turned into a<a href="media-products.html#prototype">prototype.</a> </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> This process has demonstrated how important each iteration, adaptability, and feedback responsiveness are. It proved that I could adjust to changing needs for the project while maintaining the right balance between style and functionality.</p>

                <h2>Wireframes Portfolio</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>An important step in creating a portfolio that fitted the Iterative Design learning outcome was creating the wireframes it. This assignment emphasized how important it is to reflect on early ideas, take feedback into account, and iteratively improve my work in order to produce a finished product that satisfies both functional and subjective expectations. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> After the fall break, I started working on my portfolio midway through the semester. I previously worked on a GitWiki during my third semester. After my pretty much instant feedback moment, I got told to hurry up since I was already behind compared to the rest of my fellow students. Hence, I quickly threw together a design that I deemed satisfactory. Using old elements from my previous portfolio as the design wasn't an issue, it was the content. So I used the same logo, colours and icons. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> I had to create a portfolio that showcased my learning outcomes as well as my individual tastes and style. While I had less time, the objective was to produce a portfolio that was both professional and useful while still feeling distinctive and personal. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Initial Design: In order to speed up the process, I utilized components from my portfolio from the previous semester, including the logo, colour scheme, and icons. I was able to quickly create a functional portfolio because of this. </li>
                        <li>Evaluation: I discovered that the first coding version did not satisfy my aesthetic tastes or personal standards after finishing it. I decided that making something I was proud of was important because it was a personal portfolio. </li>
                        <li>Redesign: In an effort to create a cleaner, more polished appearance, I switched to a darker black and purple design. I looked through Dribbble to get ideas and found design components like:  </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A carousel for showcasing projects.</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A clean header with hamburger-style side navigation.</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Minimalist layouts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Iteration: I updated my wireframes and implemented the updated design using these concepts. After looking over the updated design, my coach decided it better fit my objectives.   </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  I was pleased with the finished portfolio design, which matched my goal of a clean, minimalist look. It kept functionality and esthetic in mind while adding additional features based on research. The task showed how important it is to keep thinking about the products that you're making even if u think it is finished u should stay critical about your work. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The benefits of the iterative design process can be seen by this task. Although the portfolio's first iteration met with the necessary standards, it was only after critical thinking and redesigning that I was able to produce something that accurately reflected my personality. I was able to adjust and improve through iterative design, producing a final product that I was happy with and proud to showcase. </p>

                <h2>Wireframes SprintX</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>In order to meet the client's request to digitize their current Excel sheet for tracking student progress, the wireframes for Sprint X are the first step. The design approach suits the Iterative Design learning outcome since it featured asking feedback, iterative improvement, and consideration of client needs. This task showed how iteration and feedback can turn early, simple concepts into a useful product. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> The client requested a tool that is basically a digital copy of the Excel document they used to monitor the status of student projects. While keeping the original sheet's clarity and overview, the application had to manage several classes over several years and include particular features like admin permissions and thorough student progress monitoring.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> I had to create wireframes in order to deliver a solution that was useful to the client, they didn't care for style or esthetic as long as the functionality was there. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Research and Initial Wireframes: To begin, I examined the client's current Excel document to determine its composition and functionality. This served as the basis for my first wireframes.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Login Screen: Designed to manage user roles (e.g., admins with editing rights).</li>
                                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Subject Selection Screen: Defaulted to the client's subject, metal, for simplicity.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Class Selection Screen: Included dropdown menus for years (Year 2, 3, 4) and corresponding classes.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Iteration Based on Feedback: My coach recommended I don't lose the original functionality, that meant keeping the original Excel sheet's fast overview feature. The class overview screen underwent two iterations as a result: </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Version 1: Included profile pictures and detailed information for each student.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Version 2: Mimicked the Excel sheet format for a concise overview, displaying only names and project progress.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Detailed Student and Project Screens: </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Student Screen: Showed the portfolio of projects completed this year and in previous years.</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Project Screen: Included tabs for project description, student submissions, and teacher feedback. The top of the screen displayed project status and grade.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Refinement: I lastly went to the client for their thought to see if it needed more refinement and they asked if I could print these wireframes so he could show his fellow teachers, he later returned to me with positive remarks. Saying it was just as he imagined</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong> The client's Excel sheet was successfully digitalized and more while maintaining its essential features in the final wireframes. The designs were  easy to use and made sense. I made sure the product fulfilled the client's expectations and improved on their current capabilities with just the Excel sheet. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The value of Iterative Design was emphasized by this task. The class overview screen's changes were nice to preserve the Excel sheet's essential features while improving the user experience. I got a better understanding of how to properly iterate based on feedback with client requirements and expectations through this iterative process. </p>
