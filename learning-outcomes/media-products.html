                <h2>Target Audience Survey</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I created a Google Forms survey to learn more about the AI Fairytales project's possible audience. The objective was to learn more about parents' and caregivers' requirements, preferences, and expectations with relation to interactive, artificial intelligence-generated storytelling for kids. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> To make sure the product will satisfy the demands of the stakeholders, my team wanted input from the target audience. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> In order to gather information on important topics including storytelling preferences, the value of educational materials, and desired interface, I was given the task to put together and distribute a survey. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I created a brief, easy-to-use survey and distributed it to parents and caregivers directly as well as on social media. The questions centered on their expectations for interactions with children, their interest in AI-generated content, and how frequently they utilize digital storytelling tools. In order to better comprehend the survey's flow and eliminate unnecessary questions, this survey was later recreated with the use of a flowchart.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  Although the survey produced useful early perspectives, its statistical reliability was limited due to the small number of replies. In spite of this, the data provided helpful advice for adjusting the project's course, emphasizing important concepts like the significance of educational value and user-friendly design. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The result reaffirmed the importance of using a bigger sample size in studies to guarantee reliable results. But it also showed the value even small-scale surveys have in determining creative direction, offering crucial early feedback that would have affected the progress of our project. (Had i not switched semesters of course.) </p>

                <h2>Brandguide Patched Studio</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>My classmates and I worked together to design this brand guide for Patched Studio. It creates the visual identity of our studio and guarantees a cohesive, modern aesthetic throughout the branding. My biggest contributions were centered on button design elements, standards for logo usage <a href="iterative-design.html#logo">of the logo's we designed,</a> and telling my members about modern design standards like rounded edges. Through voting and feedback, I also contributed to the final color scheme selection.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> To establish our identity, our design studio required a complete brand guide that included design guidelines, typography, color schemes, and logos.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> My tasks were establishing standards for logo usage, designing modern button components, and making sure rounded edges were applied consistently. I also offered suggestions while the color scheme was being chosen.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Logo Misuse: Clearly defined guidelines were created on the proper use of the logo, including limitations on placement, monochromatic usage, and background color choices.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Design Elements: To guarantee a modern, clean user interface with rounded edges, i made button styles, including ghost buttons.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Color Palette Feedback: I took part in the selection process by looking over, evaluating, and voting on several palettes inspired by the dark theme of Visual Studio Code before settling on the current one.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  Patched Studio's visual identity was successfully established by the brand guide, which also got good reviews from team members and teachers. My work made sure the brand kept a consistent, polished appearance and followed modern design trends.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The importance of attention to detail in brand design was shown by this task. I learned how crucial it is to strike a balance between creative input and design principles, which resulted in an effective and well-received brand guide.</p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I produced a fully functional website prototype for Studio Patched, which is the last version of <a href="iterative-design.html#patched">our wireframes and mockups.</a> Inspired by Visual Studio Code's dark mode, this website has a fun yet polished feel that perfectly conveys the essence of our design studio. It includes a clear display of our work, a section under "about us" that includes team images, and a title of our specialization. This task demonstrates my ability to create digital media that is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use, which aligns with my Interactive Media Products learning outcome. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Studio Patched needed a website to highlight our team members, finished projects, and creative services. The objective was to produce an appealing, simple to use and colorful one-page website that struck a balance between our studio's creative style and professionalism.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> I was in charge of converting the wireframes and mockups i made into a fully functional website prototype. The prototype had to incorporate team images and project displays, use our final color scheme, which was influenced by Visual Studio Code's dark mode, and have a consistent layout throughout. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Swapped out the pictures to give them a more design studio feel rather than a business one.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Modified the colors to match to our final color palette.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Changed the font to make it easier to read on the new colors.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Added functionality to everything that needed it. Making it a prototype instead of a mockup.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  The finished website prototype was consistent with Studio Patched's identity, laid out in the <a href="#brandguide">brandguide</a>, and fully functional. It successfully conveyed our brand as a creative and pleasant designstudio. My team was pleased with my final result, complementing the design and colour usage. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> My ability to convert design ideas into fully working interactive media was improved by this task. I showed how to produce a product that meets expectations of stakeholders and respects the brand identity. I improved my ability to find a balance between creativity and functionality via feedback and iterations, which I’m sure will help me in my future. </p>

                <h2>Prototype Fix That UX Zekur</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I worked with two students to redesign the ZEKUR website as part of the "Fix That UX" assignment. Our goal was to make the process of getting health insurance easier to navigate and more efficient. I produced a working prototype by incorporating my ideas from my <a href="iterative-design.html#fixthatux">wireframes</a>, including tables and more coherent information, into their wireframes. Because I was capable of successfully mixing design and usability improvements, this project demonstrates my proficiency with interactive media goods. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> There were a number of issues with the ZEKUR website, such as difficult navigation and a complicated health insurance registration procedure. In order to improve the user experience, we began to revamp the website, paying attention to navigation and streamlining the sign-up procedure.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> Two of my classmates and I worked together to develop a prototype that solved these issues. It was my duty to offer suggestions, improve the design, and make sure the prototype complied with user requirements. To increase usability and clarity, I also included components like tables and other information.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> We began by analyzing the wireframes that my teammates had already produced. I helped by making recommendations for improvements including utilizing tables to properly display information and including a progress bar for the sign-up process. Once the design was complete, we later used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to <a href="development.html#zekur">create a website</a> out of this prototype that accurately represented the finished idea. I also set up a usertest to see how well our transformation worked. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  The stated pain points were successfully dealt with thanks to the prototype. The process of signing up for health insurance was made easier to navigate and more aesthetically pleasing. The findings of the <a href="#testUX">usertest</a> showed that users also found the website easier to use.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The importance of teamwork and communication when creating successful interactive media products has been proven by this task. My group members and I were able to produce a well-rounded prototype by combining our thoughts. </p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p> I tested our updated ZEKUR website prototype with a young adult who was interested in health insurance for the first time in order to gauge its efficiency. Finding any usability problems and making sure the prototype fulfilled user expectations were the objectives.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Our prototype targeted young adults as one of the main user groups and sought to streamline ZEKUR's health insurance sign-up procedure. Testing the design and flow's intuitiveness for someone who was not familiar with health insurance procedures was crucial.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong>To find areas for improvement, I had to evaluate the website's usability, see how a user interacted with it, and get feedback. I was able to examine their navigational patterns and identify any problems by recording the session.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong>I invited an possible end user to utilize the prototype to sign up for health insurance during the test. They chose a package after navigating through the pages and utilizing the features. To make sure all of the observations were noted, the session was recorded. According to their comments, I saw that although the content and navigation were understandable, the labels on the "Continue" button varied from page to page, occasionally saying "Continue," "Next," or "Go Further." I quickly made changes to the prototype to improve clarity by using consistent button labeling.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong> The website was straightforward to use, and the packages were detailed enough for the end user to make an informed choice. No significant usability issues were found, and the test was successful aside from the button label issue. The consistency and effectiveness of the prototype have been improved by the changes made from the usertest.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong>The significance of minute details in user experience design was emphasized by this usertest. Even though the design worked well overall, fixing small errors like button labels can greatly improve user satisfaction. I will make sure that consistency is a priority in my designs going forwards.</p>

                <p> In order to connect my portfolio website with the Interactive Media Products learning outcome, it was important that I do a usability test. It addressed any possible problems and made sure the website's functioning and design matched user expectations. Testing the interactive features and navigation with a classmate gave me useful information that improved my work.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong>As my portfolio website was being developed, I had to make sure it was user-friendly. I first thought about trying it out on a recruiter I knew. But, as advised by my coach, I went with a classmate. The idea was that since the portfolio was meant to showcase my learning outcomes rather than serve as a tool for job applications, a student would better comprehend its objective. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong>  Finding any usability problems or areas where the website may be improved, especially for accessing learning objectives and projects, was the task. Testing particular interactions, such using the site carousel, was part of this.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Testing Configuration: I assigned the student three distinct tasks: </li>

                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Navigate to a learning outcome page.</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Navigate to a project page.</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Switch between projects using the homepage carousel.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Observation: I paid attention to the student's interactions with the website throughout the test, noting any areas of difficulty or misunderstanding.  </li>
                        <li>Review of Feedback: Following work completion, I obtained feedback regarding their experience and recommendations for improvement. </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>The user-friendly design of the website was demonstrated by the student's successful completion of every task without any major problems. Nevertheless, they offered two remarks:
                    <ol>
                        <li>They found it inconvenient that there was only text in the clickable section for learning objectives at the bottom of the homepage. To fix this, I expanded the clickable region to include the complete box that wraps around the text. </li>
                        <li>They recommended making the side navigation open when hovered over rather than when clicked. After giving it some thought, I realized that this was a personal preference and decided to keep the current style. </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> This usertest confirmed the effectiveness of the website's design and navigation while revealing tiny areas for improvement. I made sure that the finished product had proper usability by listening to feedback and considering subjective recommendations. The procedure illustrated how crucial user testing is since other people always look at your product differently than u do and sometimes u might not realise an obvious improvement that someone else instantly notices. </p>

                <p>Working on the Interactive Media Products learning outcome during the past semester has given me the opportunity to look more deeply into the fields of design, prototyping, and usability testing. The process involved a variety of tasks, such as developing functional prototypes, improving user experience through iterative testing, and using surveys to identify audience needs. Every project offered different difficulties as well as chances for me to use and hone my interactive media design abilities. This reflection looks at how these events shaped me as a designer and improved my understanding of the value of stakeholder collaboration and user-focused design. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> I worked on several projects this semester that called on me to produce interactive media products that matched stakeholder expectations and user demands. These projects included redesigning the ZEKUR website for the "Fix That UX" assignment, creating a brand guide and prototype for Patched Studio, and conducting a target audience study for AI Fairytales. Although each of these projects had different objectives, they were all united by the importance of striking a balance between usability and visual appeal while keeping an user-friendly design.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> My primary tasks across these projects included designing, testing, and refining interactive media products. This involved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Creating surveys to gather insights about target audiences.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Collaborating with teammates to establish a brand identity and create functional prototypes.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Improving user experience through usability testing and incorporating feedback into iterative design processes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I took several steps to ensure the success of these projects:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Survey Creation: To learn more about parents' and caregivers' preferences for AI-generated storytelling tools, I created and distributed a Google Forms survey. A flowchart was then used to improve the survey's clarity.</li>
                    <li>Brand Guide and Prototype Development: By establishing guidelines for logo usage, voting and brainstorming, I helped my design studio Patched create its brand guide. Additionally, I converted wireframes into a working website prototype using Visual Studio Code's dark mode as inspiration.</li>
                    <li>UX Redesign and Testing: I added usability-focused components, like as tables and progress bars, to the wireframes for the ZEKUR website. In order to find and fix navigational problems, I also carried out usability testing.</li>
                    <li>Portfolio Testing: To make sure my portfolio clearly conveyed my learning objectives and projects, I conducted a usability test on it with a peer. I was able to assess subjective navigation preferences and enhance the clickable areas with the help of the session's feedback.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  This work led to obvious results:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Early design decisions were guided by the survey's useful, albeit limited, data.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The cohesiveness and consistency with current design standards of the Patched Studio brand guide and prototype were complimented.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Positive user feedback from testing indicates that the ZEKUR makeover made the website easier to use.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">To improve usability and satisfy users, my portfolio underwent multiple iterations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> These situations taught me how crucial user input is to the development of interactive media products. Usability can be greatly impacted by minor features like enlarging clickable areas or consistent button labels. These projects' collaborative style also taught me how to incorporate various perspectives into a finished result. I want to keep improving my ability to strike a balance between creativity and practicality going forward, making sure that user needs and goals of stakeholders guide most design choices.</p>
