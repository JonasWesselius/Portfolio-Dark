                <h2>Github Version Control</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>An essential ability for tracking and overseeing changes in development projects is version control. I used GitHub for version control during the semester, which allowed for efficient teamwork, progress monitoring, and workflow organization. This experience has a clear connection to the learning outcome: Development, as it demonstrates my proficiency with industry-standard tools for well-organized and productive coding procedures.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> We needed a solution to easily track changes, manage our code collectively, and make sure that our work remained error-free and well-organized for one of our group projects. To meet these requirements, I suggested using version control with GitHub. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> It was my responsibility to set up GitHub as our project's version control system, working with other team members to ensure appropriate branching, committing, and merging procedures.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I made the project's structure, including images, code, and documentation folders, and created a GitHub repository.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">To prevent conflicts in the main branch, I made distinct branches for each team member to work on specific elements.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">To track progress, frequent commits with accurate commit messages were recommended. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I made made sure all code passed testing before merging into the main branch, handled merge conflicts when they occurred, and reviewed changes using pull requests during integrating.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I also gave my teammates a quick lesson on how to use GitHub efficiently, going over the fundamentals like cloning, pushing, and pull requests.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong> Our project was made easier by using GitHub. It made sure that everyone had access to the most recent version of the project and made it possible for us to swiftly find and fix any problems. My team gave me good feedback because Github made it simpler to monitor progress and record changes. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> My knowledge of version control and sharing code improved as a result of using GitHub. It confirmed the significance of upholding proper steps and good us of comments within a group. It shows my ability to use industry standard tools that enable effective, professional-level coding, which is in line with the Development learning outcome. </p>

                <h2>Portfolio Coding</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Throughout the semester, my portfolio was a constantly changing. After my reassignment to Semester 2, it changed from its initial GitWiki format for Semester 3 to a custom website. This change required me to create a user-friendly layout, and adjust to new requirements.    </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> I started the portfolio in Semester 3 and organized and presented my work using GitWiki. However, I was moved to Semester 2 halfway through, which meant switching from GitWiki to a completely customized website. Tight deadlines and the fact that I had to create a website from scratch were among the new difficulties brought about by this change. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> I had to design, code, and launch a working portfolio website that successfully displayed my work. The website also has to satisfy the assessment requirements for Semester 2. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong>   
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">In order to realize my idea, I started by wireframing and building a website with a light tone and purple accents.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I wanted a hamburger sidenavigation, so i followed a youtube tutorial and changed the code to suit my website properly. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I used HTML and CSS because I’m most familiar with the languages, and Javascript for all the functionality that I’d struggle to do with just css like carousels</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I improved the design and functionality by implementing the feedback from my peers and coach found in feedpulses. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I thoroughly documented my work throughout the Christmas holiday, created detailed explanations for every learning objective using the STARR method, and included them to the website. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  The finished website was a big step up from the original GitWiki. It has interactive features including the sidebar menu, a well-designed layout, and clean look. I hope the assessors feel the same way about the website and the content in it.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The importance of self-learning and flexibility in development was shown with this assignment. The transition from GitWiki to a website drove me to pivot to coding a website instead of just putting my content in a wiki. Utilizing internet tutorials for particular features, such as the sidebar menu, shows my capacity to learn and apply knowledge on my own. This project also showed the iterative design of my portfolio, since a functioning and aesthetically pleasing portfolio required constant input and modifications. </p>

                <h2>Zekur Coding</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Effectively working together on a UX enhancement project showed that I could contribute my particular knowledge while working as a team. I collaborated with two classmates to improve the user experience and streamline the process getting health insurance on ZEKUR's website. This project shows my contributions to development by showing how I applied design concepts, working together, and code to produce a useful, user-focused website.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Our goal was to enhance ZEKUR's website's usability, with a particular emphasis on making the process of obtaining health insurance more simple and aesthetically pleasing. We were able to combine and improve our ideas for this project because in the previous project I had finished a design on my own, while they made one with their group. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> To create a website with a user interface that is simple while maintaining ZEKUR's brand identity, we had to work effectively together. This meant that work needed to be divided, several design ideas needed to be merged together, and the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure that everyone knew how it worked. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong>     
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I started by teaching my classmates on how to correctly use GitHub for version control, which included managing pull requests, setting up repositories, and generating branches.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">We combined components from my solo project with their initial group design to produce a new and improved website. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">We had several tasks to complete, with each person in charge of particular website pages or functionalities. I helped with the visual layout, progress bar, footer, and navigation bar and some individual pages. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">We simplified navigation to improve the user experience by focusing on the health insurance area and differentiating between alternatives for regular users and self-employed individuals. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">To make the insurance application process more understandable and interesting, we incorporated visual elements including a progress bar, tables, and an efficient layout.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  The finished website greatly improved usability while maintaining ZEKUR's brand. The client was pleased with the health insurance process's improved useability, pleasing design, and easier navigation. The project showed our ability to work in a team,  and successful application of designs focused on user-experience. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> My instructing, developing, and teamwork abilities were improved by this project. Helping my team members use GitHub enhanced my ability to explain the tools I use, and merging different designs increased my designing skills/flexibility. The project showed my abilities to develop both aesthetically pleasing and functional websites. </p>
