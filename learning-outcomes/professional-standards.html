                <h2>Planning in Trello</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Planning and organizing must be done well in order to meet professional standards. During the semester, I used Trello to guarantee satisfactory results and manage strict deadlines.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation: </strong>During my semester, I experienced difficult circumstances, such as having to complete a four-week group project alone in just two weeks.I needed to catch up in order to complete it by the deadline. Efficient time management was important for the project's accomplishment.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> Planning and organizing the remaining workload, making sure all deliverables were finished, and maintaining the project's quality in spite of the shortened timeframe and limited capabilities were my main tasks.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I utilized Trello as my main planning and task management tool in order to handle this efficiently. I made a thorough Trello board with the format shown below:
                    Every day of the week is marked with a card that has several activities that must be completed; if any are left undone, the day goes on. If I complete all of the tasks ahead of schedule, I can begin the tasks for the following day.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  I successfully finished the assignment within the given two weeks using Trello. I was able to effectively track my progress and concentrate on the most important tasks thanks to the clear planning structure. The project was completed to the necessary standards in spite of the time constraints, and I was commended for my flexibility and time management.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> This experience reaffirmed how important it is to use a dependable planning tool, such as Trello, in order to maintain structure and efficiently manage time. I developed the ability to rapidly adjust to difficult situations and breakdown difficult work into doable parts. These abilities are in my opinion necessary to uphold professional standards and provide excellent work even when under time constraints.                </p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>The semester presented unique problems as I mixed multiple semesters, assignments, and groups while attempting to do my best to handle an unusual circumstance.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Because I had an ongoing case with the exam committee to pass the previous semester and move on to Semester 3, I started the semester in Semester 2. I was given permission to start Semester 3 after around three weeks, provided that I improved my portfolio for grading. However, I was informed that I had not fulfilled the requirements after two months in Semester 3 and was returned to Semester 2.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong>As I moved between semesters and had to get used to different groups, deadlines, and expectations, my biggest challenge was to stay on top of assignments and make progress. I also had to update my portfolio to satisfy the necessary requirements.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I was able to adjust in spite of the instability by planning my tasks and concentrating on assignments that could be finished faster. after going back to semester 2, I had to start a project that was halfway done and finish it in two weeks alone rather than the usual four to five weeks with a group.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>Even though I did my best to manage the situation, the frequent changes made it difficult for me to finish jobs completely. Nevertheless, I learned a lot about handling difficult circumstances and meeting deadlines on my own.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned how to adapt and pivot quickly because this incident. It also showed how helpful reliable plannings are to easily jump into ongoing projects. Despite the challenges, I think I managed the problem as well as I could have given the situation.</p>

                <p>In order to improve, professionals must constantly seek out and use feedback. I tracked my progress, recorded teacher feedback, and improved my work based on their suggestions using Feedpulses during this semester. Below u can see them in more detail. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Throughout the semester, I got feedback on my work via Feedpulses. These feedpulses, which covered both solo and group projects, featured thorough feedback from peers and teachers regarding my performance, development, and places for growth. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> It was my responsibility to record this feedback, evaluate it, and use the recommendations to improve the standard of my work. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> After every feedback session, I updated the Feedpulses with information on the task I had finished, the feedback I had gotten, and my plans for responding to it. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  I showed constant progress in my work by recording all feedback given to me.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> Using Feedpulses helped me understand the importance of constructive criticism and how it's beneficial to professional growth. It enabled me to maintain a high level of productivity throughout the semester. </p>

                <p>Setting up clear agreements within a team to guarantee productive cooperation is another aspect of upholding professional standards. Our team created a comprehensive studio contract that included roles, communication guidelines, and standards for accountability, attendance, and feedback. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> We required a clear contract for our group project in Semester 3 in order to organize our team and guarantee that each member made a meaningful contribution to the project's objective. This was especially important because the project needed weeks of working together. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> It was our responsibility to draft a studio contract that would guarantee accountability and uphold professional standards throughout the project by defining roles, communication channels, and responsibilities.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> Together, we created a studio contract that included the following terms for our studio, GraphicAlley(later renamed to Patched):
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Platforms for communication: Trello for scheduling and planning, Teams channel for sharing documents, and Teams chat for rapid conversation.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Roles: To define duties, each member was given a role, such as developer, strategist, or designer.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Strikes and Attendance: We implemented a strike mechanism for accountability along with guidelines for managing absences and attendance.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Planning and Responsibilities: Group feedback was routinely recorded in Feedpulse, and weekly planning meetings were scheduled for Mondays at 10:00.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Roles: To define duties, each member was given a role, such as developer, strategist, or designer.</li>
                        Additionally, we stressed the importance of open communication, offering constructive criticism, and establishing a safe atmosphere for learning.
                        To officially declare our agreement, the contract was signed by each member after it was completed.
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  Our team has a strong basis thanks to the studio contract. We were able to concentrate on project requirements, guarantee accountability, and minimize misunderstandings. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> It made it clear how important precise agreements and organized teamwork are to upholding professional standards. We increased our productivity and made sure that each member made a significant contribution to the project by creating and following the studio contract. </p>

                <h2>Mind mapping</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Maintaining good standards requires learning professional tools and practices. By making a mindmap about mindmapping itself during the introduction week, I was able to better understand the concept's structure and practical applications.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> I learned how to use mind mapping as a method for organizing and visualizing ideas during the first week of the semester. We were required to make a mindmap on the idea of mindmapping itself in order to comprehend its function and application. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> It was my responsibility to research mindmapping and demonstrate my comprehension by generating an orderly, lucid visual depiction of its components.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I started by generating ideas for mind mapping's essential elements, including its goals, resources, methods, and advantages. I used them to organize my mindmap, which has the main idea of "mindmapping" and branches for creativity, problem-solving, brainstorming, and organization. Details and examples were provided for each branch's minor subtopics. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  The finished mindmap, which served as a complete visual manual for mind mapping, was approved of by my teachers. I gained a better understanding of how to apply this strategy for project planning and conceptualization thanks to the exercise.               </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned the importance of organizing and visual thinking from this exercise. For me, being able to make and use mindmaps is a professional standard since it helps so much with planning and getting a general idea of what type of concept u have in mind and visualizing it. It is a straightforward but effective tool that supports professional norms for  imaginative problem-solving. </p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Word webbing is also a method to do research and conceptualization, this makes it a good skill to master for your professional growth. I was able to research about how technology, society, and education can influence learning in the upcoming years by creating a word web on the future of education during the introduction week.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> During the introduction week I was given the assignment to investigate the future of education by illustrating its main features and potential. The purpose of this exercise was to get us to consider learning innovations and trends critically. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> My assignment was to construct a word web that embodied my thoughts on the direction of education, organizing them and illustrating their relationships.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I started by coming up with a list of fundamental ideas for the future of education, including sustainability, technology, accessibility, and individualized learning. I then arranged these themes into a word web, with "Education" at its core and branches out to associated ideas like students, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered learning, teachers, and classrooms. Examples and possible difficulties were included to each branch.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  The finished word web offered a complete and interesting depiction of education's future. Teachers commended its depth and organization, pointing out how well it contained important factors and their connections.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> I was able to improve my ability to generate thoughts and arrange complicated concepts thanks to this practice. I was able to critically analyze educational trends and their effects by creating the word web, which is in line with professional norms of strategic and forward-thinking thinking.</p>
