                <h2>Blik Theatre Stylescape</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>The Blik Theatre's stylescape attempted to portray the essence of the theater by combining professionalism, emotion, and playfulness into a cohesive brand identity.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Blik Theatre required an original rebranding, or maybe just some branding in general, that mirrored its function as a playback theatre for public performances and team-building exercises.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> I had to design a stylescape that reflected the theater's basic principles of inclusivity, creativity, and connection. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I looked at color schemes, typography, and imagery through my research. I incorporated human-focused graphics to emphasize narrative and teamwork, and I used strong typefaces and warm, brilliant colors to communicate liveliness and connection.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  My finished stylescape was well received within the team, but we ended up choosing someone else's stylescape by vote.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> This assignment strengthened my ability to communicate emotions visually and the ability to match a brand's emotional core with its design.</p>

                <h2>Blik Theatre Moodboard</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>My moodboard for Blik Theatre captured the mood and emotional tone of the theatre. It would have contributed to laying the groundwork for the creation of the theatre's design and branding. (Once again, had i not switched semesters) </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> To create a unified visual style that mirrored its lively, playful, and emotionally impactful character as a playback theatre, Blik Theatre required a moodboard.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> I was given the task of making a moodboard that used the font, colors, and photography to communicate the theater's key values of creativity, connection, and playfulness. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I put together a set of images that i associated with theatre plays along with vivid color schemes, and emotive imagery. Warmth, inclusion, and the vibrant energy of live performance were the main points of emphasis. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  I think the moodboard would have served as a useful starting point for the design process even if it made up a comparatively minor portion of the final project. It would have helped the development of the following branding materials and assisted in bringing the team's vision into alignment. Aside from the stylescapes of course.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The significance of moodboards as a quick and efficient tool for conveying visual direction was made apparent by this assignment, in this case it helped with creating a stylescape. I think moodboards are a very useful way of early designing and communicating ideas.</p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Planning and organizing must be done well in order to meet professional standards. During the semester, I used Trello to guarantee satisfactory results and manage strict deadlines.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation: </strong>During my semester, I experienced difficult circumstances, such as having to complete a four-week group project alone in just two weeks.I needed to catch up in order to complete it by the deadline. Efficient time management was important for the project's accomplishment.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> Planning and organizing the remaining workload, making sure all deliverables were finished, and maintaining the project's quality in spite of the shortened timeframe and limited capabilities were my main tasks.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I utilized Trello as my main planning and task management tool in order to handle this efficiently. I made a thorough Trello board with the format shown below:
                    Every day of the week is marked with a card that has several activities that must be completed; if any are left undone, the day goes on. If I complete all of the tasks ahead of schedule, I can begin the tasks for the following day.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  I successfully finished the assignment within the given two weeks using Trello. I was able to effectively track my progress and concentrate on the most important tasks thanks to the clear planning structure. The project was completed to the necessary standards in spite of the time constraints, and I was commended for my flexibility and time management.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> This experience reaffirmed how important it is to use a dependable planning tool, such as Trello, in order to maintain structure and efficiently manage time. I developed the ability to rapidly adjust to difficult situations and breakdown difficult work into doable parts. These abilities are in my opinion necessary to uphold professional standards and provide excellent work even when under time constraints.                </p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>In my opinion using Github for version control, especially in group project, is essential to properly keep track of your progress. That's why I used GitHub for version control during the semester, which allowed for efficient teamwork, progress monitoring, and workflow organization. This experience has a clear connection to the learning outcome: Development, but also with Professional Standards as it demonstrates my proficiency with industry-standard tools for well-organized and productive coding procedures.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> We needed a solution to easily track changes, manage our code collectively, and make sure that our work remained error-free and well-organized for one of our group projects. To meet these requirements, I suggested using version control with GitHub. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> It was my responsibility to set up GitHub as our project's version control system, working with other team members to ensure appropriate branching, committing, and merging procedures.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I made the project's structure, including images, code, and documentation folders, and created a GitHub repository.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">To prevent conflicts in the main branch, I made distinct branches for each team member to work on specific elements.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">To track progress, frequent commits with accurate commit messages were recommended. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I made made sure all code passed testing before merging into the main branch, handled merge conflicts when they occurred, and reviewed changes using pull requests during integrating.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I also gave my teammates a quick lesson on how to use GitHub efficiently, going over the fundamentals like cloning, pushing, and pull requests.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong> Our project was made easier by using GitHub. It made sure that everyone had access to the most recent version of the project and made it possible for us to swiftly find and fix any problems. My team gave me good feedback because Github made it simpler to monitor progress and record changes. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> My knowledge of version control and sharing code improved as a result of using GitHub. It confirmed the significance of upholding proper steps and good us of comments within a group. It shows my ability to use industry standard tools that enable effective, professional-level coding, which is in line with the Development learning outcome. </p>

                <h2>Pivoting Semesters</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>The semester presented unique problems as I mixed multiple semesters, assignments, and groups while attempting to do my best to handle an unusual circumstance.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Because I had an ongoing case with the exam committee to pass the previous semester and move on to Semester 3, I started the semester in Semester 2. I was given permission to start Semester 3 after around three weeks, provided that I improved my portfolio for grading. However, I was informed that I had not fulfilled the requirements after two months in Semester 3 and was returned to Semester 2.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong>As I moved between semesters and had to get used to different groups, deadlines, and expectations, my biggest challenge was to stay on top of assignments and make progress. I also had to update my portfolio to satisfy the necessary requirements.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I was able to adjust in spite of the instability by planning my tasks and concentrating on assignments that could be finished faster. after going back to semester 2, I had to start a project that was halfway done and finish it in two weeks alone rather than the usual four to five weeks with a group.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>Even though I did my best to manage the situation, the frequent changes made it difficult for me to finish jobs completely. Nevertheless, I learned a lot about handling difficult circumstances and meeting deadlines on my own.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned how to adapt and pivot quickly because this incident. It also showed how helpful reliable plannings are to easily jump into ongoing projects. Despite the challenges, I think I managed the problem as well as I could have given the situation.</p>

                <p>In order to improve, professionals must constantly seek out and use feedback. I tracked my progress, recorded teacher feedback, and improved my work based on their suggestions using Feedpulses during this semester. Below u can see them in more detail. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Throughout the semester, I got feedback on my work via Feedpulses. These feedpulses, which covered both solo and group projects, featured thorough feedback from peers and teachers regarding my performance, development, and places for growth. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> It was my responsibility to record this feedback, evaluate it, and use the recommendations to improve the standard of my work. </p>

                <h2>Research UX Websites</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I researched the usability and user experience of Zekur's current website while working on the project. This required determining the problems that prevented users from effectively understanding and finding the insurance options. In line with my learning outcome of professional standards, the result served as the basis for developing a more efficient and user-friendly website.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Analyzing and enhancing Zekur's insurance website's user experience was part of the project. My objective was to improve the platform's usability and accessibility for as many users as possible. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> It was my responsibility to find usability problems and suggest fixes. To improve the user experience overall, this involved looking at the site's layout, navigation, and content clarity.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> To do this, I thoroughly researched and assessed the website to identify any problems. The primary issues were unclear buttons, a home screen reserved for freelancers, and unnecessary scrolling due to large letters. I also evaluated how hard it was to access important features like "Calculate Premium" and how few options there were to customize for extra insurance. I brainstormed several solutions, such as revamping the navigation, increasing the visibility of buttons, and adding features like summaries of combined insurance benefits. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  I was able to redesign the website with an emphasis on better user experience and navigation thanks to the research findings. A unmissable "Continue" button, a smaller font size for simpler browsing, and simplified navigation are some of the modifications I made. U can see more changes on the actual <a href="iterative-design.html#fixthatux">wireframes</a> themselves. The website's usability and clarity were greatly improved by these changes. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> This task shows how important testing happy flows and possible errors users might run in to are to producing successful designs. Delivering a polished and user-friendly product required recognizing and resolving pain areas. </p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>One of the most important parts of the Fix-That-UX project was showing Hike One the updated ZEKUR's user interface. Despite only having two weeks to do the assignment, I made sure my presentation was clean, professional, and confident—all of which clearly related to the Professional Standards learning objective. The client's comments highlighted how important confidence and communication skills are in this field of work. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> I had to show Hike One, the client, my ZEKUR UX revamp. My struggle, given the time limits, was to not only produce a high-quality solution but also to successfully present my work in a way that demonstrated my thoughts and vision.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> Presenting my research, designs, and mockups in an interesting, professional, and understandable way was the task. I had to show that I had done the research on the problems, thought of possible solutions, and designed them in a short amount of time. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Preparation: I organized the presentation, focussing on the design process, research, and end results. I backed up my arguments with visuals like mockups and wireframes. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Delivery: I gave a confident presentation while keeping my composure and speaking clearly. I concentrated on providing clarification for my choices, trying to not sound too complicated with technicalities. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Engagement: I paid close attention to the client's responses, modified my tone as necessary, and made sure I answered their questions if they had any.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  My presentation left a lasting impression on the client. They said that I successfully showcased my work and decisions, and they praised my professionalism, fluency, and confidence. The only feedback was to make my vocabulary simpler for clients who are not technical so that my presentations might be easier to follow for more people in the future. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The value of clear communication in work environments was shown by this experience. Although my presenting abilities were complemented, the advice to make technical language simpler pointed out a obvious area for improvement. I'll try to effectively convey concepts to every client by changing my vocabulary to fit various different levels of clients. All things considered, the presentation confirmed my capacity to maintain professional standards during presentations and confidently represent my work. </p>

                <p>Setting up clear agreements within a team to guarantee productive cooperation is another aspect of upholding professional standards. Our team created a comprehensive studio contract that included roles, communication guidelines, and standards for accountability, attendance, and feedback. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> We required a clear contract for our group project in Semester 3 in order to organize our team and guarantee that each member made a meaningful contribution to the project's objective. This was especially important because the project needed weeks of working together. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> It was our responsibility to draft a studio contract that would guarantee accountability and uphold professional standards throughout the project by defining roles, communication channels, and responsibilities.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> Together, we created a studio contract that included the following terms for our studio, GraphicAlley(later renamed to Patched):
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Platforms for communication: Trello for scheduling and planning, Teams channel for sharing documents, and Teams chat for rapid conversation.</li>

                        Additionally, we stressed the importance of open communication, offering constructive criticism, and establishing a safe atmosphere for learning.
                        To officially declare our agreement, the contract was signed by each member after it was completed.
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  Our team has a strong basis thanks to the studio contract. We were able to concentrate on project requirements, guarantee accountability, and minimize misunderstandings. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> It made it clear how important precise agreements and organized teamwork are to upholding professional standards. We increased our productivity and made sure that each member made a significant contribution to the project by creating and following the studio contract. </p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>It takes good research into a number of topics, including reading levels, attention spans, and creative storytelling techniques, to determine how to make fairytales interesting, age-appropriate, and digestible for kids. Along with exploring the effects of blue light on kids, this research offered creative substitutes for screen-based storytelling. I learned a lot about how to match methods of storytelling to technology through this approach, which directly relates to the Learning Outcome for Professional Standard. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> In order to investigate different approaches of presenting fairytales to children, I had to do some research. Finding creative, age-appropriate solutions that didn't use to much blue light since kids tend to listen to fairytales before sleeping and that might reduce their quality of sleep was the aim. But I also have to make sure the information is interesting and usable by kids at all developmental stages. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> My task was to gather information on:  </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Alternatives to conventional screen-based narrative that emphasize interactive and immersive techniques.</li>
                    <li>The consequences of blue light exposure for kids, including how it affects their development and health.</li>
                    <li>The attention span of kids in different age groups to make sure the suggested solutions are fit for their mental capacities.</li>
                    <li>Reading levels using the AVI system, to tailor content for different age ranges.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Exploring Alternatives:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I came up with ideas for imaginative methods to narrate fairy tales, which led to AR glasses, interactive pillows, nightlight storytellers, and plush toys that tell stories.</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I evaluated how each idea would improve participation while resolving issues with screen addiction and blue light.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Researching Blue Light Effects:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I investigated how blue light affects children's sleep patterns, eye strain, and cognitive development.</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I thought of some practical solutions, such as blue light filters and reducing screen time before bed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Studying Attention Spans:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I researched some studies on kids' attention spans at various ages, looking at how degrees of involvement varied and how interaction can help kids stay focused.</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">This influenced suggestions for age-based storytelling forms and lengths.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Understanding AVI Reading Levels:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">In order to match fairytale content with the reading levels of various age groups, I looked into the AVI reading system.</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I suggested the storytelling techniques should enhance young readers' reading progress without being overbearing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  This research offered a broad viewpoint on how to effectively change fairytales for todays children. The suggested solutions address health issues like blue light exposure while integrating immersive technology with developmental factors like reading levels and attention spans. This guarantees a well-rounded strategy that is both creative and kid-friendly.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned from this research just how important it is to incorporate various points of view when creating solutions for kids, including those connected to technology, development, and health. This task also emphasized how important it is to base your concept ideas on properly researched data in order to guarantee their practicality and impact. </p>

                <p>Maintaining good standards requires learning professional tools and practices. By making a mindmap about mindmapping itself during the introduction week, I was able to better understand the concept's structure and practical applications.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> I learned how to use mind mapping as a method for organizing and visualizing ideas during the first week of the semester. We were required to make a mindmap on the idea of mindmapping itself in order to comprehend its function and application. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> It was my responsibility to research mindmapping and demonstrate my comprehension by generating an orderly, lucid visual depiction of its components.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I started by generating ideas for mind mapping's essential elements, including its goals, resources, methods, and advantages. I used them to organize my mindmap, which has the main idea of "mindmapping" and branches for creativity, problem-solving, brainstorming, and organization. Details and examples were provided for each branch's minor subtopics. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  The finished mindmap, which served as a complete visual manual for mind mapping, was approved of by my teachers. I gained a better understanding of how to apply this strategy for project planning and conceptualization thanks to the exercise.               </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned the importance of organizing and visual thinking from this exercise. For me, being able to make and use mindmaps is a professional standard since it helps so much with planning and getting a general idea of what type of concept u have in mind and visualizing it. It is a straightforward but effective tool that supports professional norms for  imaginative problem-solving. </p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>The creation of the "Skillz" student portfolio system for sprint X was my last project. I used modern web development tools like Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS in this project. AI technologies like Claude and Cursor, which offered help and explanations while I developed the program, improved this experience. I discovered how these technologies cooperate to produce reliably functioning and type-safe web apps by developing this application. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> In order to track student projects across multiple subjects (Metaal, Hout, Bouw, and AT), I had to create a web application. Although I knew the fundamentals of programming, I was unfamiliar with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> My goals were to: 
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Create a modern online application by learning and utilizing Next.js. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">To provide type safety to JavaScript, learn TypeScript. </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Use Tailwind CSS for efficient styling.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Using Cursor AI:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Learned the correct TypeScript syntax by using Cursor's code completion. </li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Real-time recommendations for Next.js component structures were received. </li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Received instant feedback on recommended practices and possible mistakes. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Using Claude:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Requested clarifications on things that I didn't know. </li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Obtained thorough code structure breakdowns </li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Received assistance with error resolution and debugging. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Practical Implementation:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Next.js was used to create a file-based routing system. </li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Using Typescript to make myself follow proper coding practices. </li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Tailwind CSS was used to create responsive layouts. </li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Created reusable components such as StudentCard and ProjectCard. </li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  I created a functional student portfolio application with success and acquired hands-on experience in: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Next.js file-based routing and component structure.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">How to use TypeScript.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Tailwind CSS utility classes and responsive design.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Modern web development best practices.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The combination of AI-tools proved helpful for learning: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Cursor AI provided immediate coding assistance and error prevention. </li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Claude offered detailed explanations and helped understand the "why" and “how” behind the code. </li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The hands-on project approach helped understanding and remembering the knowledge instead of watching hour long tutorials on youtube. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The most significant learning moments came when: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Understanding the difference between Next.js server and client components. </li>
                    <li>Using TypeScript's type system through practical examples. </li>
                    <li>Learning Tailwind's utility-first approach to CSS, though this was easier than expected since most of it is quite recognizable from standard CSS. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>This project showed how AI-tools can accelerate learning while building real-world applications. The project evolved from basic concepts to implementing more complex features like subject filtering and year-based project organization, all while maintaining type safety and clean code practices and good habits. </p>
